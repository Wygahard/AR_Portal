note: default packages for Android (in 'Edit' > 'Preference' > 'External Tools') can be empty because of firewall.
If that happen, turn it off and re-installyour Unity version

Addition of following extension to .gitignore because files are to heavy for GitHub
 - *.sym.so
 - *.dbg.so
/!\ That might backfire lol

Path holding those files:
*\Library\il2cpp_android_arm64-v8a\il2cpp_cache\libil2cpp
